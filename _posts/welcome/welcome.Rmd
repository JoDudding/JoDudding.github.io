Learning how to use the `distill` package is the first part.

Need to work out how to get the logo in to the nav bar.  And figure out
why the font size in charts is smaller with my theme.

Some ideas for posts are:

- factor levels wrap, substring, etc
- ggtext colour word helper
- scale pct etc
- ggpie
- str_wrap_html
- nz hexmap
- xmas tree
- theme testing
