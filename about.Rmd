  Time to particpate in the R community!
---

While I've been doing data analysis for decades, I've recently started using R
(I previously used SAS) and I've appreciated seeing the articles written by
members of the R community with different tips and techniques.  This site is to
share back and to collect my thoughts on the things I'm learning.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
